# Phase 2 Project
This project is intended to demonstrate the skills I have gained during phase 2 of Flatiron. The project comprises a single page application designed using React. The main components of the application are:  

- A navigation bar which uses client-side routing to direct the user to the different pages

- A log in form where users can either log in or create an account

- Three pages with personal recommendations in different forms of media.

- Each post has a like count that changes with user likes and a comment pane where new comments can be added.

- Logged in users can create their own recommendations to post.

## Running

The project runs through the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server project as both a static file server and managing a JSON based database and API. To run the server, from the project root use the command `npm run server`. This will launch the json-server with the site accessible from [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

The application can then be opened using the command `npm start`.
