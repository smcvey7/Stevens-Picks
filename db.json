      "text": "Mr. Sunshine is a historical drama which takes place in Joseon as the kingdom struggles to maintain not only its independence, but its very existance. The story revolves around five main characters, each with their own tragic back-story, trying to live and act according to their own unique values and ideals, even as their country is falling apart around them. This is a beautiful romantic work that I have to re-watch at least once a year.",

      "text": "This book may look intimidating, and there is a lot to learn about the world that Sanderson has created, but it eases the reader into it all in a natural way. The character are compelling and diverse and are driven by clear values, which in true romantic style, are frequently challenged by thought-provoking dilemmas. The world is unique and stunningly portrayed. A must read!",

      "text": "As a disclaimer, I grew up with one of the members of this band, and you can hear me on violin in a few of their songs, but I don't think it has biased me significantly, because Symmetry rocks!. They produce alternative rock music with interesting complex melodies and thought-provoking lyrics, but can be enjoyed both attentively and in the background while working or exercising. From the opening bars of songs like The Great Saboteur you know you're in for something special. You should definitely check them out!",

      "text": "I first heard this song in a high school English class, and even though it is not my usual style it really stuck with me. Loreena McKennitt sings this hauntingly beautiful rendition of Alfred Noyes' 1906 narrative poem on her album The Book of Secrets. Taking place in 18th century rural England, it tells the tragic love story of an unnamed highwayman and Bess the daughter of the landlord of an inn. I am amazed at the skill of both the author and the singer at allowing the reader to understand the characters, experience their romance, and to despair at the outcome in just over ten minutes. I can't help coming back to it every so often and having a good cry.",

      "text": "Definitely a soap opera, but with enough historical references and differences from English soap operas to mitigate some of the guilt that may otherwise come with such a guilty pleasure. This series tells the story of the wives and concubines of the Chinese emperor. Their internal politics and scheming for favor within the very limited confines in which they lived are fascinating, and it demonstrates how no one can be a winner under an authoritarian regime.",
